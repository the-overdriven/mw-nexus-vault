Preserving TES III: Morrowind mod names on nexusmods.com, grouped by author.

If nexusmods.com ever goes down, a modder is banned or deletes their account/mods, it's important to preserve at least the knowledge of the mods they created.

It also preserves file ids of all mods updated after 2025-01-01.

I've came up with this because web.archive.org (and human memory) is unfortunately too slow and unreliable.
